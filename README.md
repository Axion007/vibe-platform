# Monitoring Dashboard

The **Monitoring Dashboard** is an operations-facing web application designed for real-time supervision, alert orchestration, and system observability in emergency or high-impact scenarios.

This dashboard is intended for **administrators, authorities, or operators**, not end users.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **System Overview**
  - Active users
  - Ongoing alerts
  - Notification delivery metrics

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **User Registry**
  - User list with severity/risk indicators
  - Simulated status tracking

- 🚨 **Alert Dispatch & Monitoring**
  - Create and simulate alert broadcasts
  - Track alert propagation and delivery state

- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Logic**
  - Alert content generation and decision support
  - Modular inference layer (LLM-backed)

- 🗺️ **Operational Visualization**
  - Dashboard-style layout for situational awareness
  - Designed to scale to geo-spatial or real-time data sources
